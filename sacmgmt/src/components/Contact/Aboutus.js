                <h3>Founded in 1981.</h3>
                <p>We are not the largest management company in the Sacramento area, however, our intention has always been to manage a limited, select group of homeowner associations in a professional manner with the highest level of integrity, and personal attention in order to ensure a high level of quality for your homeowner association. Sacramento Management Co. Inc. is a proud member of CACM (California Community Association Managers.) With the constantly changing legislation regarding HOA's, the team at Sacramento Management continues to educate themselves through CACM and affiliates and carefully scrutinize new legislation in order to inform the HOAs of these changes.</p>
